# watson-assistant-addresses
Sample code showing how to handle addresses in a Watson Assistant bot

There are two 'skills' within this repo:
- basic_address_detection.json - this skill illustrates how a customer can create a basic address collection skill in Watson Assistant. There is some address 'detection' but for the most part this skill relies on the
user (the user of the bot) entering specific details when prompted.

- advanced_address_detection.json - this skill illustrates how a customer can create a sophisticated skill which
allows the user (the user of the bot) to enter their address in free form manner.
